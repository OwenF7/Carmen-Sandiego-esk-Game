# Carmen-Sandiego-esk-Game
Well, before Midnight, my final update is #12. I underestimated how much I still had to get done, and will continue working through the night to get the rest of it done
as soon as possible. But, if you wanted to see where the game was at by Midnight, download the version of Update #12. However, at that point in time, the writing is unfinished. 
There is still a fair amount for me to get done, and so if you wanted to see the project completely done, go with whatever the latest update is.

If you want to see the writing outside of the game, and the planning for the locations and things, here is the Document I used to help keep myself sane! https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GiGmX4oOhyRklbDnK1470d1AK_OLSHXgqN_1oBYsuC4/edit?usp=sharing
