# Carmen-Sandiego-esk-Game
Well, before Midnight, my final update is #12. I underestimated how much I still had to get done, and will continue working through the night to get the rest of it done
as soon as possible. But, if you wanted to see where the game was at by Midnight, download the version of Update #12. However, at that point in time, the writing is unfinished. 
There is still a fair amount for me to get done, and so if you wanted to see the project completely done, go with whatever the latest update is.  
If you want to see the writing outside of the game, and the planning for the locations and things, here is the Document I used to help keep myself sane! https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GiGmX4oOhyRklbDnK1470d1AK_OLSHXgqN_1oBYsuC4/edit?usp=sharing                                 

Final thoughts? *Sigh.* This project turned out to be a lot more than what I bargained for and what I imagined initially. From the time it took to research and write the text, to in the end, not sticking the landing with the EndScene. I've also come to find that the random numbers need to be adjusted as the chances of being caught are *way* too high. I have a feeling that due to this, much of the text I've written may end up going unnoticed... I've also realized after finishing, that a major flaw in this game is information overload. I wrote too much... I've also found that I may not have reached my goal for Procedural Text as it isn't *true* Procedural text. There could be an argument that the random numbers are procedural, but I think that is a fairly weak argument. I think as a secondary objective, this project would almost be more closely lined with Text Backstory... But I don't know. This project is kind of a hot mess.                                       

I think so far, really the only redeeming part of the project is that I know *A LOT* more about World war II, which is always cool and has been one of my favorite subjects to study. I also learned more about Unity's Animator and transitions, which is cool! I also got to work with Raycasting again, which is something I've wanted to do ever since I was introduced to it in Coding for Creatives class.                                     

But overall, with the amount of time it took for the project, and the amount I wrote, I am not satisfied with its quality unfortunately. I am definitely taking to heart to shrink the scope of my next project, and not to over extend myself.                            

One of these days, I'll learn my lesson of making something bigger than I can handle myself...                  

Best, Owen Freshour
